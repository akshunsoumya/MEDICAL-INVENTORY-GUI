With the help of Inventory Management software, any hospital or medical store can keep precise and updated stock records. Especially for pharmaceuticals and surgical equipment. It is one of the most significant jobs for any hospital organization.

This Project is a basically a small prototype of medical inventory software that are Present in the Medical Organizations.
In this project we used GUI. We used the module tkinter to make the GUI based functionality in this project 
In our project we worked on few main aspects/requirements of these medical organization.


WHAT IS THE CODE ALL ABOUT:

Firtsly, we import Tkinter, Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. 
In our code we mainly used functions to work all around the project…we firstly defined a main function in which we made a gui window(that is the window which is shown in the picture) In the gui window we created labels and different buttons with there different functionality..using the command function in the buttons we difened different funtionalty to those buutons
Taking an example:
In the first output screen there are many options coming in the screen i.e MEDICINE< CUSOMERS,etc… suppose we chose medicine,,, so in the medicine button we used command function and defined functionality of that medicine button …..we named the functionality or function as B1fun( IN MEDICINE button)…in that function we defined one other window of gui in which some more functionalit yare present ….one of them is add new medicine ….for this we needed an csv fie to be linked to that button of add new medicine so we added an function as csv file.
